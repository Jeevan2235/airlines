          >New York has to be one of the most famous cities in the world. Often
          referred to as the 'Big Apple', this vibrant city is known for its
          exclusive shops, flashy Broadway performances, and high-flying
          business tycoons, and it's a city that has long captivated people from
          all over the world.</v-card-text

              >The Statue of Liberty is the nation's most iconic monument, a
              symbol of hope to millions of immigrants on their way to Ellis
              Island. Tourists can visit both attractions via a ferry operated
              by the National Park Service that meets passengers at Battery Park
              and runs continuous loops throughout the day. The first stop is
              the statue, where visitors can enjoy views of both the monument
              and the New York City skyline at no charge. You can also purchase
              tickets to access the pedestal or crown, although crown passes
              sell out at least six months in advance. Be sure to wander through
              the museum in the base of the statue and check out the extensive
              educational signs, statues, and historic markers. The ferry stops
              next at Ellis Island, where there is a museum on the first floor
              of the main building, an architectural masterpiece that once
              served as the main processing center and hospital from 1892 to
              1954. On the upper level, tourists can wander the rooms of the
              quarantine wing and see some of the original bunks and facilities
              used by those hoping to start new lives. Tourists should plan at
              least a half-day to enjoy sightseeing at both attractions, or if
              pressed for time consider hopping aboard the ferry and using the
              ride to get phenomenal views of these historic landmarks from many
              angles.

              >There are weeks' worth of attractions and things to do in and
              around Times Square, but even a brief visit to experience the
              bigger-than-life excitement is worth the trip. The heart of Times
              Square is at the junction of Broadway and 7th Ave, where you will
              be mesmerized by the massive screens that announce everything from
              the newest films and shows to special presentations. The
              pedestrian areas are full of artists, performers, and tourists
              taking in the cacophony of the city and the enticing smells
              wafting from the food trucks that line the streets. While in the
              neighborhood, a visit is not complete without dinner at Sardi's
              Restaurant and a show in the world-famous Theater District.
              Traveling with the kids? You'll find plenty of family attractions,
              including Madame Tussauds, which has not only amazing waxworks and
              interactive exhibits but also offers a new perspective from the
              glass-walled viewing platform that protrudes over the sidewalk.
              Times Square is also home to a staggering number of stores, big
              and small, and no visit is complete without a stop at M&M World
              where you can't help but smile. The Empire State Building, another
              NYC icon, is within walking distance of the square and is open
              until 2am for breathtaking views of the city below.
